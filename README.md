# rest-api-learning-project

This repository contains code for a simple REST API server that enables basic manipulations of tasks.

This project was created for educational purposes, and feedback is welcome.

I explored various options for organizing code into modules, managing database dependencies, and writing tests. This version is the one I liked the most.
